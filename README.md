# Titanic Survival Prediction
Recently, I did a voluntary homework for my bootcamp on predicting the survival of passengers on Titanic based on their age, gender and other factors using R. Data taken is from kaggle.com.

I had so much fun trying to predict the survival of these passengers and I was able to use some Maths I learnt during my JC days! I absolutely love doing this very detailed report although I admit I'm quite unsure of my calculations and justifications, but I'm always willing to learn!

Here's to better reports in the future!
